-[Developer Resources: Awesome Lists](https://codeburst.io/developer-resources-awesome-lists-2c85b45a0216)

This is the official **Awesome List** for [Substrate](https://substrate.io/); it is maintained by
the [Substrate Developer Hub](https://substrate.dev/) team.

## What is Substrate?

Substrate is a framework for building upgradable, modular and efficient blockchains. Substrate is an
[open-source](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) library of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
code that is maintained by [Parity Technologies](https://www.parity.io/).
